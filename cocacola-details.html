Objective <br>
The objective of this project is to analyze Coca-Cola sales data across five states â€” Akwa Ibom, Delta, Rivers, Imo and Lagos. The aim is to identify trends, seasonal variations, and key factors influencing sales performance in these regions. This analysis will help in formulating data-driven strategies to optimize sales and marketing efforts.
<br> Approach <br> 
1. Data Collection: <br>
   - Gather sales data from Coca-Cola's regional databases for the five states over the past three years. <br>
   - Collect additional data on demographic, economic, and delivery companies in each state to understand external influences. <br>

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: <br>
   - Clean the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. <br>
   - Standardize data formats and create new features if necessary (e.g., calculating total sales or coke drink and fanta drink, and total retailers). <br>

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):<br>
   - Conduct descriptive statistical analysis to summarize sales data. <br>
   - Use data visualization techniques (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps) to identify patterns and trends. <br>
   - Perform correlation analysis to identify relationships between sales and external factors. <br>

4.  Statistical Analysis:<br>
   - Apply time series analysis to identify seasonal trends and cyclic patterns in sales data. <br>
   - Conduct regression analysis to understand the impact of various factors (e.g., population density, median income, temperature) on sales. <br>

6. Reporting:<br>
   - Compile findings into a comprehensive report with actionable insights. <br>
   - Create dashboards in Tableau/Power BI to visualize key metrics and trends for stakeholders. <br>
